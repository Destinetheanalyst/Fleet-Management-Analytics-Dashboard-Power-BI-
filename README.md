## 🎯 Key Objectives  
- Deliver a unified view of fleet activities  
- Highlight operational inefficiencies  
- Support fuel, maintenance, and resource planning  
- Improve driver performance and cost accountability  
- Enable data-driven budgeting & operational strategies  

---

# 📊 Dashboard Overview  

### **1. High-Level Fleet KPIs**

| KPI | Value | What It Means |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Liters Consumed** | 166K | Total annual fuel volume used |
| **Total Drives** | 189 | Number of trips completed |
| **Total KM Traveled** | 722K | Fleet-wide distance covered |
| **Fuel Cost** | $550K | Total cost of fuel consumed |
| **Maintenance Cost** | $171K | Planned maintenance expenses |
| **Fix Cost** | $2M | Repairs & corrective maintenance |

---

### 🔍 Insights
- Fix costs far exceed planned maintenance, indicating reliance on *reactive* repairs.  
- Fuel-related expenses dominate operating costs, suggesting demand for fuel efficiency programs.  
- KM distribution shows uneven workload across drivers, signaling optimization opportunities.

---

# 📈 Monthly Trend Analysis: KM Traveled

A monthly line chart provides visibility into operational seasonality and fleet utilization.

---

### Key Observations
- **September** records the highest travel distance, indicating a seasonal demand surge.  
- **December** shows the lowest activity (29K), likely due to holidays or scheduled downtime.  
- **April–July** remains stable with 67K–73K KM, reflecting predictable operational demand.

---

### Business Impact
- Enables resource & staffing alignment with demand cycles  
- Helps optimize fuel procurement contracts  
- Supports maintenance scheduling based on operational trends  

---

### Recommendations
- Schedule preventive maintenance during historically low-travel months.  
- Review driver and route allocation strategies to minimize sharp drops in productivity.  

---

# 🧍‍♂️ Driver Performance & Cost Diagnostics  

The dashboard includes a detailed driver table evaluating:

- KM Traveled  
- Liters Consumed  
- Fuel Cost  
- Maintenance Cost  
- Fix Cost  

Conditional formatting highlights cost outliers and efficiency variations.

---

### Key Insights
1. **Fuel Efficiency Variability**  
   Similar KM outputs across drivers show inconsistent fuel usage—indicating possible behavioral inefficiencies.

2. **High Fix Cost Concentration**  
   A minority of drivers contribute disproportionately to total repair costs.

3. **Underutilized Drivers**  
   Some drivers logged significantly lower KM, signaling uneven workload or operational inefficiencies.

4. **“No Driver” Entries**  
   These records indicate incomplete logging or system gaps affecting data accuracy.

---

# 🧠 Strategic Insights & Recommendations  

## **1. Fuel Cost Optimization**
- Standardize GPS-based routing  
- Implement driver fuel performance scoring  
- Negotiate volume-based fuel contracts  
- Consider fleet upgrades to more fuel-efficient models  

---

## **2. Proactive Predictive Maintenance**
- Adopt telematics for real-time asset health monitoring  
- Transition to preventive maintenance targeting expected breakdown cycles  
- Sync maintenance windows with downtime periods (e.g., December)  

---

## **3. Driver Performance Management**
- Introduce a formalized driver scorecard  
- Provide coaching and training to high-cost drivers  
- Optimize vehicle-to-driver assignments  

---

## **4. Operational Optimization**
- Use seasonal trends for workforce and route planning  
- Reallocate workloads to improve driver utilization  
- Investigate unexpected operational drops or surges  

---

## **5. Data Governance & Quality Improvement**
- Enforce proper logging standards to eliminate “No Driver” entries  
- Automate fleet data ingestion for accuracy  
- Implement validation rules for fuel and maintenance data  

---
